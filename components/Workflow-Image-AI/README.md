# A tool to create a research PACS integration

Integration of algorithms into the research information system allows projects to react to events like new data arriving. A pipeline can be triggered based on these events and code of the project can be run on the new data. Results are either tabulated data added to REDCap or new image data which can be added to the research PACS.

Using the tools in this section you should be able to start developing a processing pipeline and to test the processing pipeline. After such tests you can upload the pipelines to the research PACS and enable it for your project.
