## Setup

Serve the local index.php from a php server on a port such as 4444. You will need to replace "localhost" with the IP address of the hosting machine once you are connected to the competition network.

```bash
cd NekoMed
php -S localhost:4444
```

Navigate to the website:

```
http://localhost:4444/
```
